## Instructions
The program accepts 1-2 character strings ending in "\n". The first character indicates the category of instruction: move the wheels, change the speed, turn on an led, turn the head, turn on the lcds. The second character (if there is one) indicates a sub-instruction in that category.

Default Speed Value: 150

Speed Increment Value: 50
